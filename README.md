SpatialDBKitSharp
===========================

This is Xamarin.iOS port of SpatialDBKit ( https://github.com/andreacremaschi/SpatialDBKit ).   
This repository is public but maintainer is very newbie of Xamarin binding, so just experimental.  
Cause of short knowledge about Marshal Class, there are many interfaces exposured as IntPtr.  
Patches, pull requests, tests are very welcome.  

### Notice

static library file SpatialDBKit/SpatialDBKit/libSpatialiteFMDB.a is too big to commit in github, so it was compressed as patialDBKit/SpatialDBKit/libSpatialiteFMDB.a.zip.  
You must unzip it before trying to use this repository.
